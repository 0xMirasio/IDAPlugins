# IDAPlugins
A non official list of IDA plugins link sorted by categories. Feel feel to create issues/pull request, I will add the plugins. 

## Essentials

https://github.com/REhints/HexRaysCodeXplorer For better code navigation in RE process. CodeXplorer automates code reconstruction of C++ applications.
https://github.com/archercreat/ida_names IDA-names automatically renames pseudocode windows with the current function name.
https://github.com/david-lazar/IDAPatternSearch The IDA Pattern Search plugin adds a capability of finding functions according to bit-patterns into the well-known IDA Pro disassembler based on Ghidra's function patterns format.
https://github.com/eternalklaus/RefHunter RefHunter find all references in simple and lightweighted manner. 

## Decompilation Helper

https://github.com/airbus-cert/Yagi Yagi is a C++ plugin that includes the Ghidra decompiler into IDA 7.5 and 7.6.

## Time travel Debugging

https://github.com/airbus-cert/ttddbg New debugger for IDA which supports loading Time Travel Debugging traces.
https://github.com/gaasedelen/tenet/ Tenet is an IDA Pro plugin which enables reverse engineers to explore execution traces of native code

## DeObfuscation / Decoder
https://gitlab.com/eshard/d810 D-810 is a plugin which aims at removing several obfuscation layer.
https://github.com/cellebrite-srl/FunctionInliner FunctionInliner is an IDA plugin that can be used to ease the reversing of binaries that have been space-optimized with function outlining

## Dev Helper

https://github.com/eset/ipyida IPyIDA is a python-only solution to add an IPython console to IDA Pro.
http://sandsprite.com//blogs/index.php?uid=7&pid=361 jside adds JavaScript scripting to IDA, including an IDE with syntax highlighting, auto-completion and interactive debugger.
https://github.com/0xeb/ida-qscripts QScripts is an alternative to IDA's plugins IDE management.

## Cryptography

https://github.com/polymorf/findcrypt-yara IDA pro plugin to find crypto constants using yara.

## Exploit helper

https://github.com/Accenture/VulFi A query based function cross-reference finder for vulnerability research

## Binary Information & Exports

https://github.com/quarkslab/quokka Quokka is a binary exporter: from the disassembly of a program, it generates an export file that can be used without a disassembler.
https://github.com/jhftss/IDA2Obj IDA2Obj is a tool to implement SBI (Static Binary Instrumentation).
https://github.com/mahaloz/decomp2dbg decomp2dbg aims to shorten the gap of context switching between decompiler and debugger by introducing a generic API for decompiler-to-debugger symbol syncing
https://github.com/riskeco/SyncReven SyncReven lets the user connect IDA to a running Reven/Axion instance.

## Librairies management

https://github.com/airbus-seclab/AutoResolv Resolves functions imported from external libraries and refactor code.

## IDA Collaboration
(new, check out IDA Team from hexrays website)

https://github.com/Martyx00/CollaRE/ CollaRE enables collaboration using multiple reverse engineering tools for more complex projects

## IOS

https://github.com/cellebrite-labs/ida_kcpp an IDAPython module for way more convienent way to Reverse Engineering iOS kernelcaches.

## Custom Architecture
### Nitendo Switch

https://github.com/pgarba/switchidaproloader loader for the NRO Nintendo Switch binaries

### nanoMIPS

https://github.com/0rganizers/nmips IDA plugin to enable nanoMIPS processor support
